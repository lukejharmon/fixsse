This is the simulation of the jump mk model.

Here two mk models are defined. In a chosen node the matrix of the mk changes.

Use the "BiSSE_rvMK_sim.R" to simulate data and run BiSSE to check for parameter estimates under heterogeneity of character evolution.

Use the "plot_results.R" to plot the BiSSE posterior.
